/*
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The
constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set
initial values for object attributes:
constructor must have no return type
constructor name must be same as its class name 

Is it necessary to write a constructor for a class?
It is not necessary to write a constructor for a class. It is
because the java compiler creates a default constructor
(constructor with no arguments) if your class doesn't have
any.

When Java Constructor is called?
Each time an object is created using a new() keyword, at least
one constructor (it could be the default constructor) is invoked
to assign initial values to the data members
